    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     I’m a curious and focused former scientist (Ph.D.), now dedicated to helping businesses to make data-informed decisions, by exploiting big data, data visualization and data science. 

     My academic experience in hard sciences gave me a pragmatic approach to problem-solving and allows me to find the root cause of complex problems. I use Data Science techniques and methodology to leverage business data to inform stakeholders. No matter the seniority level, I’m able to convey technical messages to wide audiences and facilitate decision making using data-driven approaches. 

     I enjoy learning and I’m able to get spun up quickly on new topics. For this reason, I consider myself topic-agnostic, meaning that I’d be glad to help you in any type of data-related project, no matter your industry.




education:
    - degree: Ph.D. Chemistry
      university: Maynooth University (IE) & University of Queensland (AU)
      time: 2013-2017
      details: |
        I was awarded an International Scholarship for a joint Ph.D. programme between Maynooth University and Queensland University to study the 
        effect of bacterial resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics. The goal of the programme was to design an inhibitor to be used to decrease/stop the efficacy of the bacterial antibiotic resistance system.
        I used biophisical and biochemical techniques to study the structures of two novel bacterial proteins I identified to inhibit the mechanism of antibiotic resistance. 
        - I delivered numerous scientific presentations internationally  and produced 9 peer-reviewed articles in ~3 years
        - I tutored and teached multiple courses
        - I was visiting Ph.D. researcher for two consecutive years at Middelbury College (VT) and Oxford university (OH)
        
    - degree: M.Sc. in Industrial Biotechnology 
      university: University of Bologna
      time: 2010 - 2012
      details: |
        I graduated magna cum laude and produced one peer-reviewed. 
          - Major: Chemistry, Physics, Biology
          - One year of research conducted as part of my thesis

    - degree: B.Sc. in Biotechnology for the Food Industry
      university: University of Palermo
      time: 2007 - 2010
      details: |
        I graduated magna cum laude.
          - Major: Chemistry, Physics, Biology

    - role: Business Analyst
      time:  2016 - 2020
      company: Stripe Inc. 
      details: |
        As a Business Analyst, I worked daily with a large amount of data to report on User Experience and Onboarding flows for the global Risk team at Stripe. Daily, I used SQL and Python to generate reports, create Dashboards and create ad-hoc analysis for senior management (C-level), Project managers and Analysts. Some of the projects I’m most proud of:
          - Visualize the Onboarding flow of Risk controls and interventions using a Sankey diagram
          - Evaluate potential features to improve machine learning models, by analyzing KYC/KYB data
          - Provide recommendations to identify the time window at which a customer was onboarded   
          - Forecasting review volume to help headcount projections and outsourcing
