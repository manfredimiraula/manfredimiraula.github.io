career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     I started my career as a Scientist. I completed my Ph.D. in Chemistry between Australia and Ireland. Academia is a tough job market and I decided to switch career. 
     That's how I ended up in tech and eventually moved into Analytical roles and programming. 
     Nowadays, I spend my free time learning about programming and trading both equities and option contracts. 

education:
    - degree: Ph.D. Chemistry
      university: Maynooth University (IE) & University of Queensland (AU)
      time: 2013-2017
      details: |
        I was awarded an International Scholarship for a joint Ph.D. programme between Maynooth University and Queensland University to study the 
        effect of bacterial resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics. The goal of the programme was to design an inhibitor to be used to decrease/stop the efficacy of the bacterial antibiotic resistance system.
        I used biophisical and biochemical techniques to study the structures of two novel bacterial proteins I identified to inhibit the mechanism of antibiotic resistance. 
        - I delivered numerous scientific presentations internationally  and produced 9 peer-reviewed articles in ~3 years
        - I tutored and teached multiple courses
        - I was visiting Ph.D. researcher for two consecutive years at Middelbury College (VT) and Oxford university (OH)
        
    - degree: M.Sc. in Industrial Biotechnology 
      university: University of Bologna
      time: 2010 - 2012
      details: |
        I graduated magna cum laude and produced one peer-reviewed. 
          - Major: Chemistry, Physics, Biology
          - One year of research conducted as part of my thesis

    - degree: B.Sc. in Biotechnology for the Food Industry
      university: University of Palermo
      time: 2007 - 2010
      details: |
        I graduated magna cum laude.
          - Major: Chemistry, Physics, Biology
          
experiences:
    - role: Business Analyst
      time: 2016 - Present
      company: Stripe Inc. (Dublin)
