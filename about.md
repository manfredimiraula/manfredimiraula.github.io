Ciao, I'm Manfredi and I enjoy using data to generate insights and predictions to understand better the world we live in (as well as help businesses to make data-driven and well-informed decisions!). <span class="evidence">I'm interested in helping startups and small businesses in harnessing the power of Analytics. </span>

I was born and raised in Palermo, Sicily (IT)! My roots are very important to me and defined who I am today. I’m very direct and I try to face every challenge with a kind heart. I believe that one brain is less powerful than many brains working together and I accept constructive feedback as a way to grow personally and professionally. 
 
I completed a joint Ph.D. programme in Chemistry between the University of Queensland (AU) and Maynooth University (IE). This was a challenging yet fulfilling period of my life. I worked and traveled around the world and, between one scientific paper and an international conference, I became quite good at moving apartments internationally…!

While thinking of setting up a moving business, I decided to pause my academic career and joined a FinTech startup in Dublin, the European San Francisco. That's when I discovered my love for programming and how it can be applied to a number of fields.
 
Since then, I shifted my career to incorporate Analytics and programming into my daily routine. I'm now a passionate and always-learning programmer that uses Python to extract information from Big Data. However, my curiosity is pushing me to explore other languages and I'm in *constant learning* mode.
 
When I'm not learning or working, I enjoy doing sports. I used to rock climb a lot and I used to do a lot of CrossFit. I still do from time to time, but I've reduced the pace lately to focus more on running and Padel Tennis.

If you want to get in touch, I'm always open to new opportunities. Right now, I have ~10hrs/week to dedicate to side-projects. If you want to understand what type of projects I can help you with, feel free to jump to my Résumé page or head to the "Projects" section. I'll keep these sections constantly updated!
