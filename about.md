Ciao, I'm Manfredi and I enjoy using data to generate Insights and predictions to understand better the world we live (as well as help businesses to make data-driven and well-infromed decisions!). <span class="evidence">I'm interested in helping startups and small businesses in harnessing the power of Analytics. </span>

I was born and raised in Palermo, Sicily (IT)!

After completing a joint Ph.D. in Chemistry between University of Queensland (AU) and Maynooth University (IE), I decided to pause my academic career and joined a FinTech startup. That's when I discovered my love for programming and how it can be applied to a number of fields. 

Since then, I shifted my career to incorporate Analytics and programming. I'm now a passionate programmer that uses Python and SQL to extract information from Big Data. However, my curiosity is pushing me to explore other languages and I'm in *constant learning* mode.

When I'm not learning or working, I enjoy doing sports. I used to rock climb a lot and I used to do a lot of CrossFit. I still do from time to time, but I've reduced the pace lately to focus more on running Padel Tennis.

If you want to get in touch, I'm always open to new opportunities. Right now, I have ~10hrs/week to dedicate to side-projects. If you want to understand what tyupe of projects I can help you with, feel free to jump to my Résumé page or head to the "Projects" section. I'll keep these sections constantly updated!
